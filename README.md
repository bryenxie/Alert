# Alert!!!
Alert is a video game that simulates the life of someone in a war-torn area. Play through the daily life of this person as they try to find food and water to feed their sibling and to stay alive. Discover what war did to the area, and what people think of it. This is just one of Alert! 's many applications, and in the future it can be tailored to other specific scenarios for NGO's and charities to use, to increase their funding from donors.

Switch on the audio system, as the voice acting in this game is on point. Play it on full screen to get the maximum enjoyment. Interact with boxes, buildings, characters and rubble to get the most out of the game.
